I've had a ton of fun on Mario Kart Wii and its always interesting for me to go back in the past a little bit to see how the games have progressed.  First off, Super Circuit is fun. It's a perfect portable game. The tracks are not so long as to take up too much time, yet they are long enough to not feel too cheap and tacked on for the sake of putting a Mario Kart game out. There is a nice selection of tracks to start the game off that each require it's own type of skill to master. Sure, as always, there is a track or two that sometimes feels unnecessarily frustrating, but the fun you have on the other tracks more than make up for it. Once you get the hang of sliding around corners, using the jump button to control those turns and coming out of them with a nice little boost to shoot you ahead of your opponents, you'll be having all kinds of great fun.  There are a few different modes to choose from. You can of course go for the classic Grand Prix mode with 50, 100, or 150ccs and test your mettle against your computer foes (I hate Peach). There is the Time Trial mode in which you can learn to master the tracks with no fear of being rear ended with a dreaded red turtle shell at the finish line, and then there is the Quick Run, in which you can simply load up any track you want and race against the CPU without worrying about doing an entire Cup. Unfortunately, you need another person with a Gameboy Advance and a connector cable to play Multiplayer and since I don't have that option, I can't comment on it. All I know is that I've heard that it is better if the other person were to have their own Super Circuit cart as well. You can play with only one game and a connector cable if you wish, but it will limit your character selection.  Super Circuit also harkens the return of the coins from Super Mario Kart, which means that the outcome of the race will rely on skill as much as it does luck. Whereas the newest incarnations of the Mario Kart franchise usually require an big chunk of luck (you tend to get punished for being good), you will have to collect as many coins as you can to help your speed and to keep you from spinning out each time you get hit, which will happen when you run out of coins. Collecting coins also brings up another cool thing about the game; if you collect 100 coins in each cup after getting gold in it, it will unlock that cup from the original Super Mario Kart. So, when all is said and done, you have the potential for unlocking another five cups for a grand total of 40 tracks to race. Not too shabby for a portable racing game.  Honestly, I found this game to be more fun than I expected. It's absolutely perfect for what it's intended for. When you are out and about and have your Gameboy Advance (or DS or 3DS) with you, it's great for playing bite sized chunks at a time. It takes very little time to compete in a cup and be done with it if that is what you wish. On the other hand, there are enough tracks and it is enough fun that you could sit in your living room or on a road trip and play it for hours. I recommend this game heartily for those that are fans of the Kart.Read more","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\">             <span>As a fan of the Mario Kart series, I was anxious to finally pick up and play Super Circuit years after it's release.

For its time, its graphics were impressive, and they still look pretty good thanks to bright colors and consistent art design.  The music is catchy, the sound effects add some personality, and the overall presentation is very slick.  The gameplay feels more like the SNES Mario Kart but with some refinement. Coins still litter the tracks, which adds a metagame to the proceedings. In order to achieve high rankings in cups, players need to collect lots of coins, use items effectively, AND get good times.  The items are just as useful as they ever were, taking a page from Mario Kart 64 as far as their execution is concerned: items can be be held onto, thrown forward and backward, etc. The items are essentially a copy of everything from Mario Kart 64, and that's all that was needed here. The controls can feel a bit cramped after long periods of play due to the mandatory use of both shoulder buttons and heavy use of the D pad while the A button is held down the majority of the time. If you've played Mario Kart DS, the button layout will be practically the same on your DS. The physics, as with each Mario Kart, have their own feel this time, and are more reminiscent of the SNES title.  Lastly, and most importantly, the track design is superb. Not only are all of the SNES tracks unlockable, there's a full set of brand new ones, and many of them are some of the most clever in the whole series. The new tracks look great and play excellently, with plenty of curves and turns and obstacles, each one feeling unique, for the most part.  Mario Kart: Super Circuit main flaw is that multiplayer is relatively bust. You'll need AT LEAST multiple GBA and link cables, (can't do it on the DS) plus you'll want multiple copies of the game for the full experience. Players can't do Battle Mode against CPUs, either, which is a disappointment. That said, this title is still quite fun even with just its single player stuff, and is n my opinion one of the best GBA games out there and one of the top Mario Kart games. Give it a go if only to experience the sweet tracks and revisit old ones.Read more","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\">             <span>Mario Kart: Super Circuit is a blend of concepts from the SNES Mario Kart and the N64 Mario Kart, all squished onto a tiny GBA cart.

There is a good variety of charachters and an extremely wide range of tracks and circuit races to choose from. Plus, if you beat all of the circuits, you get to play the tracks from SNES. (In my opinion, these games aren't as good as the ones on GBA).  The multiplayer is REALLY cool. The best part on the multiplayer feature on this is BATTLE MODE. This part is where you have 3 balloons and if they are all popped by your opponent, you lose. I did find time trials on this game to be a little tough. Nintendo did a really good job with transferring this game from the SNES to the GBA. I'm sorta dissapointed, though, because the tracks lack hills and other geographic factors that are on the N64 version.
